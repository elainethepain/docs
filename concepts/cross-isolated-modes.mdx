title: "Cross & Isolated Modes"

---

Cross and isolated modes represent two different approaches to borrowing and lending in DeFi protocols. These modes determine how collateral is managed, risk is distributed, and positions are liquidated. Understanding the differences is crucial for effective risk management.

### How Cross Mode Works

**Unified Collateral Pool**
- All assets in your account serve as collateral
- Collateral is shared across all positions
- Higher capital efficiency and flexibility

**Risk Distribution**
- Risk is spread across all positions
- One position can affect others
- More complex risk management

**Liquidation Mechanics**
- Account-level liquidation threshold
- All positions liquidated together
- Higher risk of complete account liquidation

### Advantages of Cross Mode

**Capital Efficiency**
- Maximum utilization of available collateral
- Higher borrowing capacity
- Better capital allocation

**Flexibility**
- Easy position management
- Quick asset reallocation
- Simplified account structure

**Lower Fees**
- Reduced transaction costs
- Fewer separate positions to manage
- Streamlined operations

### Risks of Cross Mode

**Contagion Risk**
- One bad position affects all others
- Higher risk of complete liquidation
- Difficult to isolate problematic positions

**Complex Risk Management**
- Harder to track individual position risk
- Account-level monitoring required
- More sophisticated risk assessment needed

## Isolated Mode (Isolated-Margin)

### How Isolated Mode Works

**Separate Collateral Pools**
- Each position has dedicated collateral
- Positions are independent of each other
- Clear risk isolation

**Position-Specific Risk**
- Risk limited to individual positions
- No cross-position contamination
- Easier risk assessment and management

**Targeted Liquidation**
- Only specific positions are liquidated
- Other positions remain unaffected
- More predictable liquidation outcomes

### Advantages of Isolated Mode

**Risk Isolation**
- Position-specific risk management
- No contagion between positions
- Easier to manage individual positions

**Clear Risk Assessment**
- Simple position-level monitoring
- Predictable liquidation scenarios
- Better risk control

**Flexible Position Sizing**
- Customize collateral per position
- Adjust risk per strategy
- Independent position management

### Risks of Isolated Mode

**Lower Capital Efficiency**
- Collateral cannot be shared
- Higher capital requirements
- Reduced borrowing capacity

**Higher Fees**
- More transactions required
- Separate position management
- Increased operational complexity

## Choosing Between Modes

### When to Use Cross Mode

**High Capital Efficiency Needed**
- Maximize borrowing capacity
- Optimize capital allocation
- Active trading strategies

**Experienced Users**
- Sophisticated risk management
- Account-level monitoring capabilities
- Understanding of contagion risks

**Portfolio Management**
- Unified account management
- Cross-position optimization
- Simplified operations

### When to Use Isolated Mode

**Risk Management Priority**
- Conservative risk approach
- Position-specific strategies
- Clear risk boundaries

**New Users**
- Easier to understand
- Predictable outcomes
- Safer learning environment

**Diversified Strategies**
- Different risk profiles per position
- Independent strategy execution
- Isolated position testing

Understanding cross and isolated modes is essential for effective DeFi borrowing and lending. Choose the mode that best fits your risk tolerance, experience level, and strategy requirements. Both modes have their place in a well-diversified DeFi strategy.
