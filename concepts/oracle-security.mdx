Oracle security is fundamental to Kamino's risk management system. Price feeds provide real-time market data that determines collateral values, liquidation thresholds, and position health. Understanding oracle security helps users assess the reliability of the protocol's risk management.

## How Price Feeds Work

### Oracle Architecture

Kamino uses a sophisticated oracle system to ensure accurate and secure price data:

**Multi-Source Validation:**
- **Primary Oracles**: Main price feed sources
- **Backup Oracles**: Secondary sources for validation
- **Cross-Validation**: Multiple sources confirm price accuracy
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic switching if primary sources fail

### Price Feed Sources

**LST Oracle Infrastructure:**
- **SOL LST Feeds**: Specialized oracles for Liquid Staking Tokens
- **Depeg Protection**: Advanced mechanisms to prevent depeg liquidations
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuous price monitoring and updates
- **Historical Validation**: Long-term price accuracy verification

## Security Measures

### Oracle Manipulation Protection

**Advanced Security Features:**
- **Time-Weighted Averages**: Prevents short-term price manipulation
- **Volume-Weighted Pricing**: Considers trading volume in price calculation
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifies and filters anomalous price movements
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic halts during extreme volatility

### Decentralized Oracle Network

**Network Security:**
- **Multiple Validators**: Independent price validation
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Agreement required for price updates
- **Reputation Systems**: Track record of oracle accuracy
- **Incentive Alignment**: Rewards for accurate price reporting

## LST Oracle Infrastructure

### SOL Multiply Protection

**Depeg Protection:**
- **LST-Specific Oracles**: Specialized feeds for liquid staking tokens
- **Depeg Detection**: Advanced algorithms to detect depegging events
- **Automatic Safeguards**: Built-in protections against depeg liquidations
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of LST prices

### Oracle Reliability

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- **Price Deviation**: Maximum allowed price deviation
- **Update Frequency**: How often prices are updated
- **Latency**: Time between market changes and oracle updates
- **Accuracy History**: Long-term performance tracking

## Risk Management

### Oracle Failures

**Failure Scenarios:**
- **Network Issues**: Connectivity problems affecting price feeds
- **Manipulation Attempts**: Deliberate price manipulation
- **Market Volatility**: Extreme market conditions
- **Technical Failures**: Oracle infrastructure problems

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Backup Oracles**: Multiple redundant price sources
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic halts during suspicious activity
- **Manual Override**: Emergency procedures for critical situations
- **Insurance Mechanisms**: Protection against oracle failures

### Position Protection

**User Safeguards:**
- **Health Factor Monitoring**: Continuous position health tracking
- **Liquidation Alerts**: Early warning systems for at-risk positions
- **Emergency Procedures**: Clear protocols for oracle failures
- **Compensation Mechanisms**: Fair treatment during oracle issues

## Oracle Governance

### Parameter Management

**Adjustable Parameters:**
- **Price Deviation Limits**: Maximum allowed price changes
- **Update Frequencies**: How often prices are updated
- **Oracle Selection**: Which price feeds to use
- **Security Thresholds**: Risk management parameters

### Community Oversight

**Governance Involvement:**
- **Parameter Voting**: Community votes on oracle parameters
- **Oracle Selection**: Community input on price feed sources
- **Emergency Procedures**: Community oversight of emergency measures
- **Transparency Reports**: Regular updates on oracle performance

## Best Practices

### For Users

**Risk Management:**
1. **Monitor Oracle Health**: Check oracle status regularly
2. **Understand Limits**: Know oracle deviation limits
3. **Diversify Positions**: Don't over-concentrate in single assets
4. **Stay Informed**: Follow oracle-related announcements

### For Developers

**Integration Guidelines:**
1. **Use Official APIs**: Integrate with Kamino's official oracle feeds
2. **Implement Fallbacks**: Have backup price sources
3. **Monitor Performance**: Track oracle accuracy and latency
4. **Follow Security**: Implement recommended security measures

## Oracle Performance

### Accuracy Metrics

**Performance Indicators:**
- **Price Accuracy**: How close oracle prices are to market prices
- **Update Latency**: Time between market changes and oracle updates
- **Uptime**: Percentage of time oracles are operational
- **Manipulation Resistance**: Effectiveness against price manipulation

### Historical Performance

**Track Record:**
- **Long-term Accuracy**: Historical performance over time
- **Crisis Performance**: How oracles performed during market stress
- **Improvement Trends**: Ongoing enhancements to oracle systems
- **Community Feedback**: User experience with oracle reliability
