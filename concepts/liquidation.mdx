## Overview

Liquidation is a risk management mechanism that protects the Kamino protocol and its users. When positions become undercollateralized, they can be liquidated to maintain system solvency.

## How Liquidations Work

### Liquidation Triggers

A position can be liquidated when:

- **Health Factor < 1**: The position's health factor drops below the liquidation threshold
- **Undercollateralization**: The value of borrowed assets exceeds the allowed collateral ratio
- **Oracle Price Changes**: Significant price movements that affect collateral value

### Liquidation Process

1. **Detection**: The protocol continuously monitors all positions
2. **Liquidation Call**: Liquidators can call the liquidation function
3. **Partial Liquidation**: Up to 50% of the position can be liquidated
4. **Liquidation Bonus**: Liquidators receive a bonus for performing liquidations

## Liquidation Analysis Suite

Kamino's **Multiply Liquidation Analysis Suite** provides sophisticated risk assessment tools for users to understand their position risk with real-time data and simulations.

### Core Features

The suite consists of 4 core sections:

#### 1. Overall Stats
- **Average Leverage**: Market-wide leverage statistics
- **Average LTV**: Loan-to-Value ratios across all users
- **Average Net APY**: Current profitability metrics
- **Market Risk Appetite**: Indicators of overall market sentiment

#### 2. My Risk Summary
- **Personal Position Overview**: Your specific risk metrics
- **Net APY Calculation**: Current profitability of your position
- **Time to Liquidation**: Simulated liquidation timeline
- **Risk Assessment**: Real-time position health evaluation

#### 3. Interest Rate & Utilization Simulation
- **Interactive Risk Modeling**: Adjust parameters to test scenarios
- **LST APY vs Borrow APY**: Compare earning vs borrowing rates
- **Utilization Impact**: See how utilization affects rates
- **90D PnL Projections**: Forward-looking profitability estimates
- **Custom Scenarios**: Test different leverage levels and utilization rates

#### 4. Historical Utilization
- **1-Year Historical Data**: Long-term utilization patterns
- **Rate Stability Analysis**: How quickly spikes flatten
- **Market Behavior**: Understanding utilization cycles
- **Coming Soon**: 30D, 90D, 180D, 360D average utilization metrics

### Interest Rate Risk Explained

For SOL Multiply positions, the primary risk is **interest rate risk**:

- **SOL Borrow Rate Spikes**: When borrow rates exceed LST APY
- **Net APY Impact**: Reduced profitability when rates are unfavorable
- **Liquidation Risk**: Extreme scenarios where positions become unprofitable

### Risk Quantification

The Liquidation Analysis Suite answers critical questions:

- **How extreme do rates need to be** for liquidation risk?
- **What's my time to liquidation** under different scenarios?
- **How does utilization affect** my position's profitability?
- **What historical patterns** should I consider?

## Best Practices

### Risk Management
1. **Monitor Health Factor**: Keep above 1.5 for safety
2. **Use Liquidation Analysis Suite**: Regularly assess position risk
3. **Understand Rate Dynamics**: Know how utilization affects rates
4. **Diversify Strategies**: Don't over-concentrate in single positions

### Using the Analysis Suite
1. **Check Overall Stats**: Understand market conditions
2. **Review Personal Risk**: Monitor your specific position
3. **Run Simulations**: Test different scenarios
4. **Study Historical Data**: Learn from market patterns

## Accessing the Suite

The Liquidation Analysis Suite is available to all Multiply users and provides:

- **Real-time Data**: Live market information
- **Interactive Simulations**: Test various scenarios
- **Historical Context**: Long-term market analysis
- **Risk Quantification**: Precise risk measurements
