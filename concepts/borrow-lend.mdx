Borrowing and lending are the fundamental mechanics that power Kamino's DeFi protocol. Users can supply assets to earn interest and borrow against their collateral to access liquidity.

## How It Works

### Supplying Assets

When you supply tokens to Kamino, they are transferred to the protocol's liquidity pools. These pools facilitate overcollateralized borrowing while allowing suppliers to earn interest on their digital assets.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic Interest Accrual**: Supplied tokens automatically earn interest based on current market rates
- **Collateral Usage**: Supplied assets can be used as collateral for borrowing
- **Dynamic Rates**: Interest rates adjust based on market conditions and utilization

### Borrowing Assets

Borrowing on Kamino allows users to access liquidity while maintaining their position in supplied assets. The protocol uses an overcollateralized model to ensure system security.

**Borrowing Process:**
1. **Supply Collateral**: First, supply assets to the protocol
2. **Check Borrow Capacity**: Your borrow capacity depends on your collateral value and borrow factors
3. **Borrow Assets**: Access liquidity up to your available borrow capacity
4. **Manage Position**: Monitor your health factor and manage your position

## Interest Rate Model

Interest rates on Kamino are determined by:

- **Utilization Rate**: The proportion of assets currently borrowed vs. total supplied
- **Market Conditions**: Dynamic rates that respond to supply and demand
- **Governance Parameters**: Protocol-level settings that can be adjusted

## Position Risk & Liquidations

### Health Factor

Your position's health factor determines liquidation risk:

- **Health Factor > 1**: Safe position, no liquidation risk
- **Health Factor = 1**: At liquidation threshold
- **Health Factor < 1**: Position can be liquidated

### Borrow Factors

Different assets have different borrow factors, affecting how much you can borrow against your collateral. Higher borrow factors mean more borrowing capacity.

## Cross & Isolated Modes

Kamino offers two borrowing modes:

### Cross Mode
- Use all supplied assets as collateral
- Higher borrowing capacity
- More complex risk management

### Isolated Mode
- Use specific assets as collateral
- Lower borrowing capacity
- Simplified risk management

## Fees

### Supply Fees
- **Interest Earned**: Suppliers earn interest on their supplied assets
- **No Supply Fees**: No fees for supplying assets

### Borrow Fees
- **Interest Paid**: Borrowers pay interest on borrowed amounts
- **Borrow Incentives**: Some assets offer borrowing incentives

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Health Factor**: Keep your health factor above 1.5 for safety
2. **Diversify Collateral**: Use multiple assets as collateral to reduce risk
3. **Stay Informed**: Monitor market conditions and protocol updates
4. **Use Risk Management**: Consider using isolated mode for simpler risk management
